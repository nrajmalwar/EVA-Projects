## Create your own Library

1. Work on the your own library- Convert your code such that you have 4 additional files in 4 folders: 
  * data 
  * loss 
  * model 
  * optim_scheduler 
 
2. Use these files to import related functions to train your model. Your ipynb files can only have training loop, and everything else must be imported.
