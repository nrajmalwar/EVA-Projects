## Train a Tiny-YOLO on Colab

1. Collect 200 images (more the better) for any 1 class of your choice- I have chosen MotoGP bikes as my class
2. Annotate the 200 images for the bounding boxes by running main.py file from this link- https://medium.com/@today.rafi/train-your-own-tiny-yolo-v3-on-google-colaboratory-with-the-custom-dataset-2e35db02bf8f
3. Train YOLO for at least 1000 epochs
4. Run your model on a youtube video for object detection

Here's the youtube video with the bounding boxes identified-
