# Assignment 1A #

In this assignment, we will manually provide the values of 3x3 kernel in order to see how it functions. The kernels are designed to extract specific features from the image. 

First, let's have a look at our image:

If we just look at the edges in the image, we will get the following image:

Now, we show kernels and the corresponding image for the following feature extraction:

## 1. Vertical Edge Detector ##

A vertical edge is detected when there is a sudden change in pixel intensity along the x-direction.

## 2. Horizontal Edge Detector ##

A horizontal edge is detected when there is a sudden change in pixel intensity along the y-direction.

## 3. 45 Degree Angle Detector ##

A 45 degree angle is detected when there is a sudden change in pixel intensity along the 45 degree or 135 degree angles.
